# A guide for High School students to learning iOS/iPhone Application Development and Swift
Having studied iOS application development and Swift for the past three years, I believe that there fails to exist a single learning path to gaining proficiency in this domain. This is my attempt to create one.


Just about a year ago, I published my first learning guide for high schoolers on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. As it was well-received by the general public, with many individuals indicating to me that it helped their progress tremendously. As a result, I decided to do the same for another sub-domain of Computer Science that I have a stark interest in - iOS Development and Swift.


The main purpose of Swift is to build applications that can be published on the Apple App Store. Being a relatively new language, Swift has been developed by Apple to be a language that priortizes simplicity, efficiency and interpretability over all, which is what makes it trump other languages such as Java and Objective-C when it comes to developing applications. 


In this guide, I outline a series of steps that, from my experience, will allow one to go from a beginner level to an advanced level in a matter of months. It does assume a basic proficiency in programming - variables, loops, methods, etc, but nothing much more. I do believe that iOS Development is one of the most promising areas in software development, and thus would encourage any party interested in this area to read this guide.


So, let's get to it.


### 1. Understanding the basic syntax of Swift
Like any other programming language, Swift has a syntax unique to itself. While I've never been an advocate for memorizing the syntax of any language, I do believe that it is important for one to immerse themselves with the very basics prior to exploring a language. 

The advantage of Swift is that its syntax is trivially easy - it shouldn't take more than a day of exploring to get familiar with it. Swift probably has a simpler syntax than any of the major languages out there (bar Python, maybe).
